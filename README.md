# readme-generator

## Description

This readme generator takes input from the user, using inquirer, to generate a readme based on specific prompts. Those prompts will form a readme that includes all the necessary information to show a good readme for a project, including the project title, description, usage, installation, contributors, github, and email address. There is also a table of contents created that is below the title and description and links directly to different sections titled usage, installation, contributors, and questions-the last of which includes the github and email address of the user.

## Notes:

There was difficulty getting the license badge images and descriptions to show up.
